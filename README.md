# checkers-compressor

takes a 2d array representing a checkerboard and turns it into the smallest amount of bites that I could easily manage

turned out to be 88 bits or 11 bytes

- 0 = empty
- 1 = black pawn
- 2 = red pawn
- 3 = black king
- 4 = red king

# unimportant notes

- idk the actual name of a pawn in checkers off the top of my head
- black goes first in checkers
- if you can jump you have to jump or checkers loses all thought
